Description: The package ABAEnrichment is designed to test for
        enrichment of user defined candidate genes in the set of
        expressed genes in different human brain regions. The core
        function 'aba_enrich' integrates the expression of the
        candidate gene set (averaged across donors) and the structural
        information of the brain using an ontology, both provided by
        the Allen Brain Atlas project. 'aba_enrich' interfaces the
        ontology enrichment software FUNC to perform the statistical
        analyses. Additional functions provided in this package like
        'get_expression' and 'plot_expression' facilitate exploring the
        expression data, and besides the standard candidate vs. background
        gene set enrichment, also three additional tests are implemented,
        e.g. for cases when genes are ranked instead of divided into
        candidate and background.
